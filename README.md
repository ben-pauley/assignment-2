## My Repository
In this GitHub repository, you will find my completed assignment for week 3 of the programme. My task was to create a mobile responsive portfolio using the Bootstrap CSS Framework, so that no matter what size browser window the user views the page, the elements will respond accordingly and be laid out in a sensible and logical manner. I believe the website I created achieves this and is well-presented overall.

## Installation

Nothing is required to install my project, but the project is deployed live at this URL https://ben-pauley.github.io/assignment-2/.

## Software Used

This project was completed using Visual Studio Code and I tested the website using Google Chrome. I also used a lot of Bootstrap elements, which are referenced in the link tag at the top of my html pages.

## Conclusion

This task was extremely challenging. I learnt a lot along the way, and I know if I had no time constraints, I would be able to make countless more additions and improvements to my site. I did, however, very much enjoy the challenge.
