                <h2>My Coding Experience</h2>
                <h5>Prior Experience</h5>
                <p>During my time at high school, we weren't taught any coding, even though I was really interested in it. For this reason, I decided to do Computer Science at A-Level. I really enjoyed it, but struggled to excel in it as there wasn't much focus on coding.</p>
                <p>After college, I joined the University of Hertfordshire, where I studied Computer Science for a further year, only to discover that the University lifestyle wasn't for me. I wanted a change of pace after this.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Boot Camp</h5>
                <p>When I discovered the Coding Boot Camp at the University of Birmingham, my passion for coding was reignited. The possibility of doing an intensive course dedicated to web development really excited me, and I was ecstatic when I found out I had secured a place from November 2020.</p>
                <p>My experience of the Boot Camp so far has been very positive. I've really enjoyed learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I am, however, really excited to dive deep into JavaScript. I believe my passion lies largely in the logic of programming more than the presentation.</p>
